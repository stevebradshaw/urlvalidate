# URL Validator

Allows an input control to have javascript/php URL validator assigned to it, and when a URL is entered and the focus moves from the input, validation that the URL is valid is run.

Can specify a <span> to receive a simple message describing the status of the URL, and also an <img> to display an image based on the status.
